# VEET Manager
The Visual Environment Evaluation Tool (VEET) device is a pair of temple arm form-factor devices that allow a researcher to gather visual information that the eye receives throughout the day without interruption of normal activities. The VEET Manager software helps configure and manage data collected by the VEET.

You can learn more about VEET by visiting the website [https://projectveet.com](https://projectveet.com), or looking at the [documentation](/documentation/VEET%202.0%20Device%20Manual.pdf).
